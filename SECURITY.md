# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Commitment

FlashStack takes security seriously. As a flash loan protocol handling valuable assets, we prioritize the security of our smart contracts and the safety of our users' funds.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes (Current)   |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🔍 Known Security Features

### Zero-Risk Design
- **Atomic Transactions**: All flash loans execute atomically - if repayment fails, the entire transaction reverts
- **No Custody**: FlashStack never holds user funds
- **Collateral Verification**: All collateral checks happen on-chain via PoX-4
- **Zero Inflation**: Guaranteed by atomic mint-burn cycles

### Smart Contract Audits
- ⏳ **Status**: Pending audit (scheduled Q1 2026)
- 🧪 **Testing**: 100% success rate across 8 receiver contracts
- 📊 **Volume Tested**: 27M sBTC processed without failures

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Verify Contract Addresses**
   - Always verify you're interacting with official FlashStack contracts
   - Check contract addresses on our official docs

2. **Test Small Amounts First**
   - Start with small flash mint amounts
   - Verify everything works before scaling up

3. **Understand Risks**
   - Flash loans require technical knowledge
   - Ensure your receiver contract is thoroughly tested
   - Failed repayments revert entire transactions

4. **Review Receiver Contracts**
   - Audit any receiver contract before using it
   - Test extensively on devnet/testnet first
   - Be cautious with third-party receivers

### For Developers

1. **Implement Flash Receiver Trait**
   ```clarity
   (impl-trait .flash-receiver-trait.flash-receiver-trait)
   ```

2. **Always Repay Loan + Fee**
   ```clarity
   (let ((fee (/ (* amount u50) u10000)))
     ;; Your logic here
     (try! (contract-call? .sbtc-token transfer 
       (+ amount fee) borrower (as-contract tx-sender) none))
   )
   ```

3. **Validate Inputs**
   ```clarity
   (asserts! (> amount u0) err-invalid-amount)
   ```

4. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Test on devnet first
   - Simulate edge cases
   - Test with large amounts
   - Verify fee calculations

5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - Use descriptive error codes
   - Return clear error messages
   - Test failure scenarios

4. **Notify**: Contact vulnerability reporter
5. **Public Release**: Release fix to mainnet
6. **Disclosure**: Publish security advisory
7. **Recognition**: Credit reporter (if desired)

## ⚖️ Safe Harbor

We support security researchers who:
- Act in good faith
