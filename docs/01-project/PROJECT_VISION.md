# FlashStack Project Vision

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: December 6, 2025
**Status**: Active Development

---

## Mission Statement

**FlashStack brings flash loans to Bitcoin's Layer 2 ecosystem, enabling capital-efficient DeFi strategies without upfront collateral.**

We are building the first automated flash loan protocol on Stacks, Bitcoin's Layer 2, to unlock new financial primitives for the Bitcoin economy.

---

## The Problem

### Current State of Bitcoin DeFi

1. **Capital Inefficiency**
   - Users need large capital reserves for arbitrage
   - Liquidators must maintain significant holdings
   - Yield strategies require upfront investment
   - MEV opportunities inaccessible to small players

2. **Market Gap on Stacks**
   - $161.5M TVL but no flash loan infrastructure
   - sBTC launch creates demand for advanced DeFi
   - 12+ DeFi protocols but no capital aggregation
   - Developers lack tools for complex strategies

3. **Competitive Disadvantage**
   - Ethereum has Aave, dYdX, Uniswap flash loans
   - Solana has Jupiter aggregation
   - Bitcoin L2 ecosystem lacking similar tools
   - First-mover advantage window (3-6 months)

---

## The Solution

### What is FlashStack?

FlashStack is a **flash loan protocol** that enables:

1. **Uncollateralized Borrowing**
   - Borrow millions without upfront capital
   - Use borrowed funds within single transaction
   - Automatic revert if not repaid
   - Zero protocol risk

2. **Capital Efficiency**
   - No collateral requirements
   - 0.05% fee (vs 0.09% Aave)
   - Atomic execution guarantees
   - Profit-driven economics

3. **Developer-Friendly**
   - Simple trait implementation
   - Clear documentation
   - Example contracts included
   - Bitcoin-native integration

## Non-Goals

What FlashStack is NOT:

❌ Not a lending protocol (no collateral deposits)
❌ Not a yield aggregator (focused on flash loans)
❌ Not a DEX (enables trading, doesn't execute)
❌ Not seeking VC funding (community first)
❌ Not closed source (fully open)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Smart contract bugs** → Audits, testing, gradual rollout
- **Stacks platform issues** → Close monitoring, emergency controls
- **Integration complexity** → Clear docs, examples

### Market Risks
- **Low adoption** → Developer outreach, grants, education
- **Competition** → First-mover advantage, quality focus
- **Regulatory** → Legal review, compliance focus

### Execution Risks
- **Team capacity** → Realistic roadmap, community support
- **Security incidents** → Bug bounty, audits, insurance
- **Ecosystem changes** → Flexible architecture, quick adaptation

---
