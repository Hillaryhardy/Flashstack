Title: [Project Launch] FlashStack - First Flash Loan Protocol on Stacks (100% Test Success)

Hey r/stacks!

I'm excited to share FlashStack, the first flash loan protocol deployed on Stacks testnet. After months of development and rigorous testing, we've achieved 100% success across all test scenarios.

## What are Flash Loans?

Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that must be borrowed and repaid within a single atomic transaction. They've become a fundamental DeFi primitive on Ethereum, enabling:
- Instant arbitrage opportunities
- Zero-capital liquidations
- Leverage loops
- Collateral swaps
- Complex trading strategies

## Why This Matters for Stacks

Until now, Bitcoin Layer 2 had no flash loan infrastructure. FlashStack brings this powerful tool to Stacks with:

- **Competitive Fees**: 0.05% (vs 0.09-0.30% on Ethereum)
- **Zero-Inflation Guarantee**: All minted tokens are burned
- **Comprehensive Toolkit**: 8 production-ready receivers
- **Battle-Tested**: 100% success rate across all tests
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and auditable

## Technical Highlights

**Testnet Results (Dec 7, 2025):**
- 8/8 tests passed
- 27M sBTC total volume processed
- 15,250 sBTC fees collected
- Largest single loan: 6M sBTC
- Zero failed transactions
- Supply maintained at 0 (zero inflation)

**Tech Stack:**
- 11 Clarity smart contracts
- ~3,500 lines of production code
- Comprehensive test suite
- Professional documentation

## Use Cases Demonstrated

1. **Arbitrage**: Profit from price differences across DEXs
2. **Liquidations**: Liquidate undercollateralized positions
3. **Leverage Loops**: Build leveraged positions efficiently
4. **Yield Optimization**: Rebalance across protocols
5. **Collateral Swaps**: Change collateral without closing positions
6. **DEX Aggregation**: Optimal routing for large trades
7. **Multi-DEX Arbitrage**: Complex cross-DEX strategies
8. **Custom Receivers**: Build your own use cases

## What's Next

- **Jan 2026**: Code4STX grant application
- **Q1 2026**: Security audit
- **Q1 2026**: Mainnet deployment
- **Ongoing**: Community feedback and developer engagement

## Get Involved

- **GitHub**: github.com/mattglory/flashstack
- **Twitter**: @FlashStackBTC
- **Testnet**: All contracts deployed and verifiable

This is just the beginning for sophisticated DeFi on Bitcoin L2. I'd love to hear your thoughts, questions, and feedback!
