Choose the receiver that matches your use case.

### 3. Study the Code
```bash
cd contracts/
cat liquidation-receiver.clar
```

### 4. Test on Devnet
```bash
clarinet console
(contract-call? .flashstack-core flash-mint 
  u1000000000 
  .liquidation-receiver)
```

### 5. Integrate Real Protocols
Replace mock functions with real contract calls.

## 📈 Real-World Examples

### Liquidation Bot
```
Position: 1,000 sBTC underwater
Liquidation bonus: 10% = 100 sBTC
Flash fee: 0.05% = 0.5 sBTC
Net profit: 99.5 sBTC (9.95% return)
```

### Arbitrage Opportunity
```
DEX A: BTC at $50,000
DEX B: BTC at $50,500 (1% higher)
Flash loan: 1,000 sBTC
Gross profit: 10 sBTC
Flash fee: 0.5 sBTC
Net profit: 9.5 sBTC (0.95% return)
```

### Leverage Position
```
Capital: 1,000 sBTC
Target: 3x leverage
Total position: 3,000 sBTC
Price +10% → +300 sBTC gain (30% return)
Without leverage → +100 sBTC (10% return)
Amplification: 3x (but 3x risk!)
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Beginner**: Start with `example-arbitrage-receiver.clar`
**Intermediate**: Try `liquidation-receiver.clar` or `collateral-swap-receiver.clar`
**Advanced**: Build with `multidex-arbitrage-receiver.clar` or `yield-optimization-receiver.clar`
**Expert**: Master `leverage-loop-receiver.clar`
