- Code examples with explanations
- Links to related docs
- Last updated date

### Naming
- Use descriptive names: `fee-mechanism.md`
- Include versions: `deployment-guide-v1.1.md`
- Use CAPS for important: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Maintenance
- Review quarterly
- Archive outdated content
- Update links
- Keep examples working

## 🔍 Finding Information

### Quick Navigation

**Want to understand the project?**
→ `01-project/PROJECT_VISION.md`

**Need to deploy?**
→ `04-deployment/TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Building a receiver?**
→ `02-technical/` (when you add INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)

**Applying for grants?**
→ `07-templates/GRANT_APPLICATION_TEMPLATE.md`

**Want to contribute?**
→ `docs/README.md` for standards

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Templates
Don't reinvent the wheel—use the templates in `07-templates/` for consistency.

### 2. Link Everything
Cross-reference related documents to create a documentation web.

### 3. Keep It Updated
Set a monthly reminder to review and update documentation.

### 4. Document as You Build
Write docs alongside code, not after. It's easier and better quality.

### 5. Get Feedback
Share docs with users and iterate based on their questions.
