## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) 2.0 or later
- Node.js 16 or later
- Git
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flashstack.git
   cd flashstack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify everything works**
   ```bash
   clarinet check
   ```

4. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

## 📝 Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Write your code**
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep functions focused and small

2. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Check syntax
   clarinet check
   
   # Run in console to test
   clarinet console
   ```

3. **Update documentation**
   - Update README.md if you added features
   - Add code comments
   - Update relevant docs in /docs folder

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add arbitrage calculator function"
   ```

   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `docs:` - Documentation only
   - `test:` - Adding tests
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `style:` - Formatting changes
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original FlashStack repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your fork and branch
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Submit!

## 🎯 Code Standards

### Clarity Smart Contracts

- **Follow SIP-010 standards** for token contracts
- **Use descriptive variable names** (`flash-mint-amount` not `amt`)
- **Add input validation** for all public functions
- **Include error handling** with descriptive error codes
- **Comment complex logic** with clear explanations
- **Keep functions under 50 lines** when possible

Example:
```clarity
;; Good ✅
(define-public (flash-mint (amount uint) (receiver <flash-receiver>))
  (begin
    ;; Validate amount
    (asserts! (> amount u0) err-invalid-amount)
    
    ;; Validate not paused
    (asserts! (not (var-get paused)) err-protocol-paused)
    
    ;; Execute flash mint
    ...
  )
)

;; Bad ❌
(define-public (fm (a uint) (r <flash-receiver>))
  ;; No validation, unclear names
  ...
)
```

### Testing

- **Write tests for new features**
- **Test edge cases** (zero amounts, max values, etc.)
- **Test error conditions**
- **Include integration tests** for receiver contracts

### Documentation

- **Update README.md** for significant features
- **Add inline comments** for complex code
- **Create examples** for new receiver types
- **Update API docs** in /docs folder

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

### Before Submitting

1. **Check existing issues** - Your bug may already be reported
2. **Use latest version** - Update to latest main branch
3. **Minimal reproduction** - Can you reproduce it consistently?

### Creating a Bug Report

Use the bug report template and include:

- **Clear title** - Describe the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** - Detailed steps
- **Expected behavior** - What should happen
- **Actual behavior** - What actually happens
- **Environment** - Clarinet version, OS, etc.
- **Code snippets** - Relevant contract code
- **Error messages** - Full error output

Example:
```
Title: flash-mint fails with err-insufficient-collateral on valid STX amount

Steps to reproduce:
1. Deploy contracts to devnet
2. Lock 100,000 STX via PoX
3. Call flash-mint with 10 sBTC
4. Transaction fails

Expected: flash-mint succeeds
Actual: Returns (err u104)

Environment:
- Clarinet 2.3.0
- Windows 11
